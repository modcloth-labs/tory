maybestatic
===========

Attempt to serve assets from the filesystem, falling back to (possibly?)
embedded assets.  Intended to play nicely with
[go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata).


## Usage

See an example [here](./examples/maybestatic-net-http-example/main.go) in which
the `Asset` func generated by
[go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata) is passed as the loader
func to a new `maybestatic.Dir`, which fulfills the
[`http.Dir`](http://godoc.org/net/http#Dir) interface.
